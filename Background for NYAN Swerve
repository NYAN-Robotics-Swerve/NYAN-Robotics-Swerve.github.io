Team 10091 NYAN Robotics started swerve in January of 2024 with a bit of work here and there being done once in a while.
As the team got closer to Illinois state competition for FTC, all work pretty much stopped till way past worlds and started up only after summer break had started.
Throughout this whole process, we have recieved a bit of help here and there to get us going in this project.
We learned a lot from other teams who have done this project as well as from teams that are currently working on those projects.
